This will be added to the .gitignore however I haven't set that up yet so whatever for now

The compiler needs to parse the necesarry files and namespaces to a new C# project in order
to use the dotnet/msbuild compiler

So yeah its kinda a parser but well call it the compiler for now HAHA

Parser step 1:
    If Build File:

        - Read the JSON build file
        - Parse all the M files
        - Parse all cx files to one master cs file

    If filename yadida:

        - Read the files imports
        - Parse the imports to the file first
