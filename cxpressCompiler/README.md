# Compilers
I am currently working on the first compiler and making good progress everyday,
a python3 version of the compiler will be made to compile a cXpress written compiler

# cxCompiler
    Usages:
        cxc <build_file_path>
        cxc <cx file> <project type> <project name>


# pyCompiler
    Usages:
        compiler.py <build_file_path>
        csc <cx file> <project type> <project name>
