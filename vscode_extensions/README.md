# VSCode Extensions

I love VSCode I know you probably do too
I primarily use Visual Studio 2022 for my .NET development I have always had a soft spot
for Microsoft's VSCode
Within this directory I will be adding all extensions that have been developped for use
with the C-Xpress language

## Current Extensions

### cxpress-file-syntax
    This extension gives VSCode support for the file syntax for cx files
    It is still a work in progress


## Coming Extensions

### cxpress-builder
    This extension will give VSCode support for building cx projects
    It has yet to begin its development
